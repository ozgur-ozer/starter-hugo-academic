 abstract = {The existing global challenges, from climate change to global inequality, need global solutions that could only be produced by a systemic approach. An effective global innovation system (GIS) may integrate innovation activities to deal with these challenges. We argue that creating a GIS is possible via the transformation of existing socio-technical system and G20 is the most fitted actor to design and govern a GIS not just because of its economic and social influence but also of its scientific and technological competence.},

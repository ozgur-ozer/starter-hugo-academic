abstract: The existing global challenges, from climate change to global inequality,
  need global solutions that could only be produced by a systemic approach. An effective
  global innovation system (GIS) may integrate innovation activities to deal with
  these challenges. We argue that creating a GIS is possible via the transformation
  of existing socio-technical system and G20 is the most fitted actor to design and
  govern a GIS not just because of its economic and social influence but also of its
  scientific and technological competence.

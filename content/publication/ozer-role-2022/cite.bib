 abstract = {Our preliminary findings show that average productivity is almost the same for both genders. However, the most prolific authors are generally men. Female authors are apt to work in teams rather than publishing alone. Our findings confirm Kwiek and Roszka regarding gender homophily in scientific publications while opposing the literature finding that men tend to cooperate with men and women with women. The likelihood of being cited is lower for the publications female authors contributed. In the following steps, we will examine the role of gender in collaboration and the mobility of researchers within and outside the country. The role of gender on research fields and the change of network parameters by gender will be analysed to examine the impact of the research field on gender and productivity relationship.},
